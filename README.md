# Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting the Force of Infection (FOI) of Japanese Encephalitis (JE)
# Summary
This is a follow-up of the previous research done by [Duy M.Nguyen and Quan M.Tran](https://github.com/m2man/JERFOUCRU), with guidance from Dr Hannah Clapham, at the National University of Singapore. 

The project's objective is to predict the FOI of Japanese Encephalitis in various regions. The previous work used Random Forest, while I explored the following methods: 

- PCR
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

The objective of my work is to provide python code examples of the above methods for future colleagues. We will also compare the methods, explain the hyperparameter tuning and discuss the prediction interval calculation that is less commonly mentioned for machine learning.
